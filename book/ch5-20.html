title: Pro Git 5.20 Distributed Git Large-Merging Workflows
---
<h2 id='largemerging_workflows'>Large-Merging Workflows</h2>

<p>The Git project has four long-running branches: master, next, and pu (proposed updates) for new work, and maint for maintenance backports. When new work is introduced by contributors, it’s collected into topic branches in the maintainer’s repository in a manner similar to what I’ve described (see Figure 5-24). At this point, the topics are evaluated to determine whether they’re safe and ready for consumption or whether they need more work. If they’re safe, they’re merged into next, and that branch is pushed up so everyone can try the topics integrated together.</p>

<p>If the topics still need work, they’re merged into pu instead. When it’s determined that they’re totally stable, the topics are re-merged into master and are then rebuilt from the topics that were in next but didn’t yet graduate to master. This means master almost always moves forward, next is rebased occasionally, and pu is rebased even more often (see Figure 5-25).</p>

<p>When a topic branch has finally been merged into master, it’s removed from the repository. The Git project also has a maint branch that is forked off from the last release to provide backported patches in case a maintenance release is required. Thus, when you clone the Git repository, you have four branches that you can check out to evaluate the project in different stages of development, depending on how cutting edge you want to be or how you want to contribute; and the maintainer has a structured workflow to help them vet new contributions.</p>
