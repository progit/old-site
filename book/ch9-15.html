title: Pro Git 9.15 Git Internals Summary
---
<h2 id='summary'>Summary</h2>

<p>Now you should have a pretty good understanding of what Git does in the background and to some degree how it is actually implemented. In this chapter we&#8217;ve covered a number of plumbing commands - commands that are more low-level and simple than the porcelain commands we&#8217;ve been covering in the rest of the book. Now that you understand how Git works at a lower level, it should be easier both to understand why it is doing what it is doing and also to be able to write your own tools and helping scripts to make your specific workflow work for you.</p>

<p>Git as a content addressable filesystem is a very powerful tool that you can easily use as more than just a version control system as well - hopefully you can use your newfound knowledge of Git internals to either implement your own cool application of this technology or feel more comfortable using Git in more advanced ways.</p><div id='nav'>
